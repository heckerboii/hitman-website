            almost felt bad for the pest... almost. Highly recommend for anyone

            me speechless. Can't thank them enough for making my neighborhood a

            anymore. Professional, efficient, and with a wicked sense of humor.

          <h3 class="title">Is this service legal?</h3>
          <p class="answer">
            Oh, absolutely! We operate within the legal gray areas like a
            skilled tightrope walker. Just kidding, we're as legal as a
            mobster's tax return. But hey, who needs legality when you have
            creativity?
          </p>

          <h3 class="title">Are your hitmen licensed professionals?</h3>
          <p class="answer">
            Licensed? Pfft! We have certificates in creative problem-solving and
            honorary degrees in evasive maneuvers. Our hitmen are more like
            artists of the underworld, painting with... let's call it
            "unconventional" brushes.
          </p>

          <h3 class="title">
            How do you ensure discretion and confidentiality?
          </h3>
          <p class="answer">
            Our discretion level is so high, even the NSA is jealous. We've
            perfected the art of secrecy to the point where even we don't know
            who hired us sometimes. Rest assured, your secrets are safe with us.
            Unless, of course, you forget to pay the bill.
          </p>

          <h3 class="title">Do you offer any guarantees?</h3>
          <p class="answer">
            Absolutely! We guarantee that our services will be... memorable.
            Whether it's the kind of memory you want to cherish forever or
            pretend never happened is entirely up to you. We also guarantee that
            you won't find a more sarcastic FAQ section anywhere else.
          </p>

          <h3 class="title">What happens if something goes wrong?</h3>
          <p class="answer">
            Ah, the age-old question! If something goes wrong, we activate our
            patented "Blame Deflection Protocol." We'll find someone or
            something else to blame faster than you can say "plausible
            deniability." But hey, remember, everything is part of the
            experience, right?
